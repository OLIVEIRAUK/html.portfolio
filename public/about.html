<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there! I'm Israel Oliveira, a 31-year-old individual with a deep interest in programming and a love for exploring the world.
 Originally from Brazil, I've been residing in England for the past three years, embracing the rich cultural tapestry of my new home.
 Programming has become my passion and I'm constantly learning, fascinated by the endless possibilities it offers. 
I find joy in unraveling the complexities of coding and exploring its creative aspects.
</p>

<p>Aside from my programming endeavors, I find solace in the world of movies. 
There's something magical about losing myself in a compelling storyline, whether it's a gripping thriller or a heartwarming drama.
My family holds a special place in my heart, and spending quality time with them is a priority.
I cherish the idea of exploring different corners of the globe, immersing myself in diverse cultures, and meeting people from various backgrounds.
My dream is to travel extensively, experiencing the beauty of different countries and cherishing the freedom to do so.
